      <p>I spent around 300$ to build this.</p>
      <p>It all started when I wanted to repair my old electric guitar. 
      Upon taking it apart I realized that there were many problems to fix 
      so I decided to start purchasing guitar parts that I liked and felt 
      had high quality. The only part I did not spend a lot of money on was
      the body of the guitar.

      <p>I became interested in computers in highschool 2014.</p>
      <p>As I picked up jobs and saved up my money I was able to save up enough money 
        to purchase pc parts and build this beautiful machine.
